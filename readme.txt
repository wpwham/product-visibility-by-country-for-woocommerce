**Product Visibility by Country for WooCommerce** plugin lets you show/hide WooCommerce products depending on customer's country. Customer's country is detected automatically by IP.

There are options in plugin to hide products by:

* Hiding **catalog visibility** - will hide selected products in shop and search results. However product still will be accessible via direct link.
* Making products **non-purchasable** - will make selected products non-purchasable (i.e. product can't be added to the cart).
* Modifying products **query** - will hide selected products completely (including direct link).
* Hiding products **prices** - will hide prices for selected products (i.e. will make products non-purchasable). Also you can optionally replace price with your own custom message.
* Outputting customizable "**product is not available in your country**" message on single product and/or archives pages.
* Hiding in **WooCommerce Blocks** - will hide selected products in blocks created with "WooCommerce Blocks" plugin.
